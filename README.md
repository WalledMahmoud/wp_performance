# WP Performance
Create a WP plugin to make test on the website speed

To create a WordPress plugin that tests the speed of a website, you will need to have some familiarity with WordPress plugin development and web performance concepts. Here is a high-level outline of the steps you could take:

- Create a new WordPress plugin by creating a new folder and adding a plugin header to a new PHP file. This will allow your plugin to be recognized by WordPress and activated on a website.

- Determine the method you will use to measure the speed of the website. There are several tools available for measuring website performance, such as Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest, and Lighthouse. You may want to consider using one of these tools, or you may want to build your own solution using performance APIs available in modern web browsers.

- Add a settings page to your plugin that allows the user to configure the options for your speed test. This could include options to select the performance measurement tool, set the testing frequency, and choose which pages or posts to test.

- Use WordPress actions and filters to schedule your speed tests and display the results to the user. For example, you could use the wp_schedule_event function to schedule a recurring task that runs your performance tests on a regular basis. You could then use the admin_notices action to display the results of the test to the user.

- Test and debug your plugin to ensure that it is working correctly. Make sure to thoroughly test your plugin on a variety of different websites to ensure that it is reliable and accurate.
